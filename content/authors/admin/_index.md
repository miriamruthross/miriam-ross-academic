# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I employ new digital cinema technologies to challenge expectations and orthodox interpretations of how they should be used. My past work has turned the screen on its side to produce vertical films; explored how DIY systems can create new stereoscopic (3D) visions; experimented with dynamic editing and narrative techniques in virtual reality (VR) film; and combined Machinima with interactive storytelling. I combine practice-based methods and traditional academic analysis, often with a media archaeology approach that emphasises what a Humanities understanding can bring to the development of new screen technologies. My work frequently focuses on global cinema dynamics, with expertise in Latin American cinema. I also consider embodiment in cinema and how gender dynamics play a role in the production and reception of audiovisual works.
