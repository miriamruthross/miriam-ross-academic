I employ new digital cinema technologies to challenge expectations and orthodox interpretations of how they should be used. My past work has: turned the screen on its side to produce vertical films; explored how DIY systems can create new stereoscopic (3D) visions; experimented with dynamic editing and narrative techniques in virtual reality (VR) film; and combined Machinima with interactive storytelling. I combine practice-based methods and traditional academic analysis, often with a media archaeology approach that emphasises what a Humanities understanding can bring to the development of new screen technologies. My work frequently focuses on global cinema dynamics, with expertise in Latin American cinema. I also consider embodiment in cinema and how gender dynamics play a role in the production and reception of audiovisual works. 
I am co-founder and administrator of
stereoscopicmedia.org and fourthVR.com
