title: Whakakitenga VR
summary: Whakakitenga is the first te reo Māori virtual reality film. The project, a collaboration between Ngāti Toa Rangatira and Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington, began with the aim of using new audiovisual technologies to explore the on-going impacts of colonisation. Written and directed by Wiremu Grace and co-directed by Miriam Ross and Paul Wolffram, Whakakitenga explores the historical world of Ngāti Toa Rangatira’s warrior, poet, gardener, and carver, Te Rangihaeata. The VR film is set in the 1840s, on the eve of Te Rangihaeata’s expulsion from his home on Mana island by British soldiers. It uses cutting edge visual effects, motion-capture performances, and spatial soundscapes to fully immerse viewers in Te Rangihaeata’s world. Whakakitenga was designed and implemented with the intention of building capacity for Māori engagement with virtual reality’s storytelling power. The project and its process have developed best-practice workflows, particularly around new technologies as decolonisation opportunities. https://whakakitengavr.com/
